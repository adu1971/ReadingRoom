<h3>To Do</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Validation, hibernate validator? "form:errors"   </li>
	<li>Restrict the delete and update operations on concepts that have child records.</li>
	<li>Use a VCS.</li>
	<li>Design the concepts class so as to build hierarchical relations between concepts. Support relation types such as is-a, contains, etc. </li>
	
</ul>

<h3>Remarks</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Consider using w3.css instead of Bootstrap. W3Schools.org contains tutorials for both.</li>
	<li> RDF OWL. Research for the already developed ontologies </li>
	<li> Decide on which javascript framework to use (Google Web Kit looks to be a strong candidate. Compare with AngularJS). JQuery is a javascript library.</li>
	<li> Project Name: Concepts Relational Concept-Document, Concept-Concept, Literature Analysis Tool, Semantic Webpage, deepsee/ConDo, Relating Literature Through Concepts, ReadingRoom, Readatorium, reed, SelfRead, ReadTogether, SocialRead, LetsRead, ReadAndThink</li>
	<li> Docbook what is </li>
	<li> My current decision is to use an RDBMS for persistence. What about using OODBMS. </li>
	<li> Doc import funtionality should include, importing the snaphot of a textual(or ad free) part of a given web page(url). </li>
	<li> Navigation Tree as in the http://docs.jboss.org </li>
</ul>
